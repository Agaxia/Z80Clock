[Z80InsnClock](https://zxe.io/software/Z80InsnClock) is a small library written in [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C) that provides T-state level precision to [Zilog Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) emulators. It allows to determine the exact clock cycle within an instruction at which the ongoing M-cycle starts, as well as its duration.

The library offers two modes of operation: Basic and Extra. Each mode increases the size of the library by 4 KiB of tables that contain patterns describing all Z80 instructions.

The Basic mode is the most simple, determining only the starting clock cycle of each M-cycle, and all related functions are inline.

The Extra mode allows knowing, in addition to the starting clock cycle, the number of extra clock cycles in the M-cycle and thus its duration, making it suitable for emulating systems such as the [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum). This mode is a bit more complex and requires calling a non-inline function during the opcode fetch.

Most users will integrate Z80InsnClock as a CMake subproject or copy its source code into their projects. In this case, if you do not need both operation modes, you can [disable](#cmake_option_z80insnclock) the compilation of the unused one.

## Installation from sources

### Prerequisites

You will need [CMake](https://cmake.org) v3.14 or later to build the package and, optionally, recent versions of [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl), [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and [Breathe](https://www.breathe-doc.org) to compile the documentation. Also, make sure that you have [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) with PDF support installed on your system if you want to generate the documentation in PDF format.

The Z80InsnClock library requires some types and macros included in [Zeta](https://zxe.io/software/Zeta), a [header-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header-only), dependency-free library used for portability reasons. Zeta is the sole dependency; Z80InsnClock does not depend on the [C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library).

### Configure

Once the prerequisites are met, create a directory and run `cmake` from there to prepare the build system:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake [options] <Z80InsnClock-project-directory>
```

The resulting build files can be configured by passing options to `cmake`. To show a complete list of those available along with their current settings, type the following:

```shell
cmake -LAH -N -B .
```

If in doubt, read the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) for more information on configuration options. The following are some of the most relevant standard options of CMake:

* <span id="cmake_option_build_shared_libs">**<code>-D[BUILD_SHARED_LIBS](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html)=(YES|NO)</code>**</span>  
	Generate shared libraries rather than static libraries.  
	The default is `NO`.

* <span id="cmake_option_cmake_build_type">**<code>-D[CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html)=(Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel)</code>**</span>  
	Choose the type of build (configuration) to generate.  
	The default is `Release`.

* <span id="cmake_option_cmake_install_name_dir">**<code>-D[CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR.html)="\<path\>"</code>**</span>  
	Specify the [directory portion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/build-settings-reference#Dynamic-Library-Install-Name-Base) of the [dynamic library install name](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/build-settings-reference#Dynamic-Library-Install-Name) on Apple platforms (for installed shared libraries).  
	Not defined by default.

* <span id="cmake_option_cmake_install_prefix">**<code>-D[CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html)="\<path\>"</code>**</span>  
	Specify the installation prefix.  
	The default is `"/usr/local"` (on [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and [UNIX-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating systems).

<span id="cmake_package_options">Package-specific options</span> are as follows:

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock">**`-DZ80InsnClock=(All|Basic|Extra)`**</span>  
	Specify which operation mode(s) to build.  
	`All` enables both `Basic` and `Extra`. `Basic` mode is the simplest and only determines the clock cycle at which the ongoing M-cycle begins, while `Extra` mode additionally provides information about the duration of the M-cycle.  
	The default is `All`.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_install_cmakedir">**`-DZ80InsnClock_INSTALL_CMAKEDIR="<path>"`**</span>  
	Specify the directory in which to install the CMake [config-file package](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-packages.7.html#config-file-packages).  
	The default is <code>"${[CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html)}/cmake/Z80InsnClock"</code>.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_install_pkgconfigdir">**`-DZ80InsnClock_INSTALL_PKGCONFIGDIR="<path>"`**</span>  
	Specify the directory in which to install the [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config) [file](https://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/pkg-config-guide.html).  
	The default is <code>"${[CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html)}/pkgconfig"</code>.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_nostdlib_flags">**`-DZ80InsnClock_NOSTDLIB_FLAGS=(Auto|"[<flag>[;<flag>...]]")`**</span>  
	Specify the linker flags used to avoid linking against system libraries.  
	The default is `Auto` (autoconfigure flags). If you get linker errors, set this option to `""`.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_object_libs">**`-DZ80InsnClock_OBJECT_LIBS=(YES|NO)`**</span>  
	Build Z80InsnClock as an [object library](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#object-libraries).  
	This option takes precedence over [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`](#cmake_option_build_shared_libs) and [`Z80InsnClock_SHARED_LIBS`](#cmake_option_z80insnclock_shared_libs). If enabled, the build system will ignore [`Z80InsnClock_WITH_CMAKE_SUPPORT`](#cmake_option_z80insnclock_with_cmake_support) and [`Z80InsnClock_WITH_PKGCONFIG_SUPPORT`](#cmake_option_z80insnclock_with_pkgconfig_support), as no libraries or support files will be installed.  
	The default is `NO`.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_shared_libs">**`-DZ80InsnClock_SHARED_LIBS=(YES|NO)`**</span>  
	Build Z80InsnClock as a shared library, rather than static.  
	This option takes precedence over [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`](#cmake_option_build_shared_libs).  
	Not defined by default.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_sphinx_html_theme">**`-DZ80InsnClock_SPHINX_HTML_THEME="[<name>]"`**</span>  
	Specify the Sphinx theme for the documentation in HTML format.  
	The default is `""` (use the default theme).

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_with_cmake_support">**`-DZ80InsnClock_WITH_CMAKE_SUPPORT=(YES|NO)`**</span>  
	Generate and install the CMake [config-file package](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-packages.7.html#config-file-packages).  
	The default is `NO`.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_with_html_documentation">**`-DZ80InsnClock_WITH_HTML_DOCUMENTATION=(YES|NO)`**</span>  
	Build and install the documentation in HTML format.  
	It requires Doxygen, Sphinx and Breathe.  
	The default is `NO`.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_with_pdf_documentation">**`-DZ80InsnClock_WITH_PDF_DOCUMENTATION=(YES|NO)`**</span>  
	Build and install the documentation in PDF format.  
	It requires Doxygen, Sphinx, Breathe, and LaTeX with PDF support.  
	The default is `NO`.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_with_pkgconfig_support">**`-DZ80InsnClock_WITH_PKGCONFIG_SUPPORT=(YES|NO)`**</span>  
	Generate and install the [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config) [file](https://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/pkg-config-guide.html).  
	The default is `NO`.

* <span id="cmake_option_z80insnclock_with_standard_documents">**`-DZ80InsnClock_WITH_STANDARD_DOCUMENTS=(YES|NO)`**</span>  
	Install the standard text documents distributed with the package: [`AUTHORS`](AUTHORS), [`HISTORY`](HISTORY), [`LICENSE-0BSD`](LICENSE-0BSD) and [`README`](README).  
	The default is `NO`.

### Build and install

Finally, once the build system is configured according to your needs, build and install the package:

```shell
cmake --build . [--config (Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel)]
cmake --install . [--config <configuration>] [--strip]
```

The [`--config`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#cmdoption-cmake-build-config) option is only necessary for those [CMake generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) that ignore [`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`](#cmake_option_cmake_build_type) (e.g., Xcode and Visual Studio). Use [`--strip`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#cmdoption-cmake-install-strip) to remove debugging information and non-public symbols when installing non-debug builds of the shared library.

### TL;DR

Use the following to build Z80InsnClock as a shared library and install it along with the development files into `$HOME/.local`:

```shell
mkdir work && cd work
git clone https://github.com/agaxia/Z80InsnClock.git
cd Z80InsnClock
mkdir build && cd build
cmake \
	-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=YES \
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR="$HOME/.local/lib" \
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local" \
	-DZ80InsnClock_WITH_CMAKE_SUPPORT=YES \
	-DZ80InsnClock_WITH_PKGCONFIG_SUPPORT=YES \
	..
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --config Release --strip
```
